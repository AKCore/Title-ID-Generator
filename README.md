# Title-ID-Generator
This software is a utility for generating random title ids for use when making homebrew NSPs

Why would I want to use this? 
When making homebrew NSPs, you need to come up with a title id for the software to make sure that it doesn't get mixed up with any other title and replaces it. With this generator, it uses only numbers too so it should only generate unique ones too.
